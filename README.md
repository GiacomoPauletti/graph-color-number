# Graph Color Number

## Overview
This project implements a high-performance algorithm to find the chromatic number of a graph. The algorithm uses a parallel branch & bound approach with heuristics to determine lower and upper bounds for the chromatic number at each branch.

This project is a solution to the student challenge for EuroHPC Summit 2025.

## Prerequisites
- MPI (Message Passing Interface) library
- OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) library
- C++17 compatible compiler

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-color-number.git
    cd graph-color-number
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cmake -B  build
    ```

3. Compile the main file (*run_instance.cpp*) with make:
    ```sh
    cd build/src/scripts
    make
    ```

## Usage
To run the executable from the root directory, use the following command:
```sh
mpirun -np <number_of_processes> ./run_instance <file_name> --timeout=<timeout> --sol_gather_period=<period> --balanced=<0|1>
```
- `<number_of_processes>`: Number of MPI processes to use.
- `<file_name>`: Name of the graph file located in the `graphs_instances` directory.
- `--timeout`: (Optional) Timeout in seconds. Default is 60 seconds.
- `--sol_gather_period`: (Optional) Solution gathering period in seconds. Default is 10 seconds.
- `--balanced`: (Optional) Whether to use balanced or non-balanced scaling strategy. Default is balanced (1).
- `--color_strategy`: (Optional) Whether to use lighter (faster but less accurate) coloring strategy *GreedyColorStrategy*, mixed (expensive but more accurate) *InterleavedColorStrategy* or heavy (uses just the most expensive) *DSaturColorStrategy*. Defaults to lighter (0).

**Note:** The sol_gather_period parameter controls the frequency of MPI communication. Lower values allow processes to share solutions and prune faster, but if set too low, they can overload MPI communication and cause errors. More MPI processes require a higher period value. It's a tradeoff between speed and stability.

Example:
```sh
mpirun -np 4 ./build/src/scripts/run_instance anna.col --timeout=120 --sol_gather_period=8 --balanced=0 --color_strategy=1
```

The logs can then be found in the *./build/src/scripts/logs* directory.

**Note:** It is recommended to use OpenMPI/4.1.4-GCC-11.3.0 and CMake/3.23.1-GCCcore-11.3.0.

## Running on a Supercomputer (Vega) with Slurm
### Load Necessary Modules
```sh
module load OpenMPI/4.1.4-GCC-11.3.0
module load CMake/3.23.1-GCCcore-11.3.0
```

### Example Slurm Script
Create a file named `run_instance_job.slurm` with the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=team2_mpi_branch_n_bound    # Job name
#SBATCH --nodes=64                             # Number of nodes
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8                    # MPI tasks per node
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4                     # Cores per MPI task
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00                        # Time limit (HH:MM:SS)
#SBATCH --partition=cpu                        
#SBATCH --output=output_mpi.txt                # Standard output file
#SBATCH --error=error_mpi.txt                  # Standard error file

# Run the MPI program
cd build/src/scripts/
srun run_instance le450_15a.col --timeout=1800 --sol_gather_period=15 --balanced=1 --color_strategy=2
```

Submit the job using:
```sh
sbatch run_job.slurm
```

## Expected Results
The script compares the computed chromatic number with the expected results stored in `expected_chi.txt`. If the computed result does not match the expected result, an error message is displayed. The results of the runs (coloring and other information) are printed to the console or to the *output_mpi.txt* if running using slurm. 

## Logs
Logs are generated for each MPI process and stored in the `logs` directory. The log files are named `log_<rank>.txt`, where `<rank>` is the MPI process rank. It contains detailed information on each branch's intermediate results (lower and upper bounds). 

## run_instance.cpp Script Details
- The script reads a graph file and initializes the MPI environment.
- It loads the expected chromatic number from `expected_chi.txt`.
- The graph is processed using the parallel branch & bound algorithm to find the chromatic number.
- The computed chromatic number is compared with the expected result.
- The script logs the execution details and results.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that the graph files are placed in the `graphs_instances` directory.
- Verify that the `expected_chi.txt` file contains the expected chromatic numbers for the graph files.
- Check the log files in the `logs` directory for detailed execution information.
