# graph-color-number
High performance algorithm for finding the color number of a graph. 
The algorithm is based on a parallel branch & bound with some heuristics to determine a lower and an upper bound for the color number at each branch of the branch & bound algorithm.

It's the solution to the student challenge for EuroHPC Summit 2025.
